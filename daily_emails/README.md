# Daily Volunteer Activity Email
## This project generates daily emails for Organizers and ROD pods that summarize metrics from the previous day.

### By Sabrina Chern (Sabrina.chern@2020victory.com) and Brent Efron (Brent.efron@2020.victory.com)
### Inspired by [MI's Dialer Output Automation](https://github.com/JoeBiden/ge_states_mi/tree/master/dialer_output_automation)
